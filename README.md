# KSPCo-op Career Mode Game

To participate, clone this branch to your saves dir.

## Your Kerbal
When you join the agency, hire or select an already-hired Kerbalnaut and rename it to your name. Don't rename the orange-suited Kerbalnauts.

## Rules
* Don't use mods that will break the save for vanilla users.
* Pull frequently.
* Don't send another player's Kerbalnaut on a mission without their consent.
* Create issues for manned missions with the Kerbalnaut assignment and launch date so that others can avoid launching the same Kerbalnaut on their mission at the same time.
* Spend the agency's money wisely and submit an issue or pull request if there needs to be a discussion.
* Don't commit the agency to unprofitable contracts.
* Push to origin as quickly as possible after conducting agency business (research, contracts, hiring).
* Don't clean up debris, except around KSC.
* Reverting and quick-saving is OK; deciding to let your mistakes stand is also OK.
* Unsuccessful missions or poor business decisions may result in disciplinary action suspension or termination of your Kerbalnaut.
* Provide prompt payment of funeral costs for Kerbalnauts who perish on your watch.
